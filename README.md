> *“A good brew is like a good friend: reliable, comforting, and occasionally in need of a little maintenance.”*  

This is a custom integration that brings your coffee brewer into the Home Assistant universe. Because life’s too short for bad coffee and disconnected devices.

*Special thanks to [Brandon Dixon (9b)](https://github.com/9b) for creating the [fellow-aiden](https://github.com/9b/fellow-aiden) Python library that laid the groundwork for this integration!*

## Configuration

### Installation parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Email** | The email address for your Fellow Aiden account. |
| **Password** | Your Fellow account password. |

### Options

After installation, go to **Settings > Devices & Services > Fellow Aiden > Configure** to change:

| Option | Default | Range | Description |
|--------|---------|-------|-------------|
| Update interval | 60 s | 30-300 s | How often the integration polls the Fellow cloud API. Lower values give faster updates but increase network traffic. |

---

## How data is updated

The integration polls Fellow's cloud API at a configurable interval (default 60 seconds). Each poll fetches the device config, brew profiles, and schedules. Historical brew and water usage data is tracked locally and kept for 365 days.

There is no local/push connection. All data goes through Fellow's servers.

---

## Removal

1. Go to **Settings > Devices & Services**.
2. Find **Fellow Aiden** and click the three-dot menu.
3. Click **Delete**.

## Supported devices

## Automation examples

Notify when a brew finishes:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Brew finished notification"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.fellow_aiden_brewer_brewing
        from: "on"
        to: "off"
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          title: "Coffee's ready"
          message: "Your brew just finished."
```

Log water usage at midnight:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Log water usage at midnight"
    trigger:
      - platform: time
        at: "00:00:00"
    action:
      - service: logbook.log
        data:
          name: "Fellow Aiden"
          message: >
            Water today:
            {{ states('sensor.fellow_aiden_brewer_water_used_today') }} L
```

## Known limitations

- No direct brew start: the Fellow API does not support starting a brew remotely. Use the physical controls or a schedule.
- Profile selection is display-only: the dropdown shows profiles but selecting one does nothing.
- Cloud-only: all data comes through Fellow's servers. If their API is down, the integration can't update.
- Single device per entry: each config entry connects to one brewer. Multiple brewers on the same account are not supported.
- Vendored library: the Fellow Aiden Python library is vendored from [9b/fellow-aiden](https://github.com/9b/fellow-aiden) and uses synchronous HTTP. The coordinator wraps calls in an executor thread.

---

## Use cases

- **Morning routine**: schedule a brew at 6:30 AM on weekdays and automate kitchen lights when brewing starts.
- **Water tracking**: monitor daily consumption and alert on unusual spikes.
- **Profile management**: create and rotate brew profiles from automations.
- **Brew logging**: track brew frequency, profile usage, and water per brew over time.

---

## FAQ & Troubleshooting

1. **"Device not found"** -- Make sure you have a Fellow Aiden brewer linked to the account you used during setup.

2. **Sensors showing "Unknown"** -- The brewer may not have reported data yet. Wait a few minutes. If it persists for days, file a bug report.

3. **"Authentication failed" after setup** -- Your password may have changed. Go to **Settings > Devices & Services > Fellow Aiden** and use **Reconfigure** to update your credentials.

4. **Diagnostics** -- Download from **Settings > Devices & Services > Fellow Aiden > (device) > Download diagnostics**. Attach to bug reports. Sensitive data (password, MAC addresses, IP) is automatically redacted.

5. **Water usage sensors show 0** -- Water tracking is cumulative and stored locally. If the store was lost, use `fellow.reset_water_tracking` to set a new baseline.
