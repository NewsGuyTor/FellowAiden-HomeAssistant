# Fellow Aiden Integration for Home Assistant

<img src="device.png" alt="Device Image" align="right" width="200"/>

> *“A good brew is like a good friend: reliable, comforting, and occasionally in need of a little maintenance.”*  

This is a custom integration that brings your coffee brewer into the Home Assistant universe. Because life’s too short for bad coffee and disconnected devices.

*Special thanks to [Brandon Dixon (9b)](https://github.com/9b) for creating the [fellow-aiden](https://github.com/9b/fellow-aiden) Python library that laid the groundwork for this integration!*

## FAQ & Troubleshooting

1. **It says “Device not found.”**  
   - Make sure you actually have a Fellow Aiden brewer configured with the same account. That helps.  
2. **I see “Unknown” for some sensors.**  
   - Possibly the brewer hasn’t updated yet or the sensor values are missing from the device’s API. Wait a minute or two (literally). Some others may take longer. Make sure to issue a bug report if they've been “Unknown” for days.
